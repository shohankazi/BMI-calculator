# BMI Calculator

I made this BMI Calculator using Python Programming language. 
Here you can check your BMI(Body Mass Index) .
It will tell you the interpretation of your BMI based on the BMI value.
1. Under 18.5 you are underweight
2. Over 18.5 but below 25 you have a normal weight
3. Over 25 but below 30 you are overweight 
4. over 30 but below 35 you are obese
5. Above 35 you are clinically obese.
